This web-based system is used to perform an information retrieval system on a collection of thesis documents. This system was built using the Laravel and Bootstrap framework, programming languages are PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and using a DBMS MySQL.

In performing the information retrieval system in the thesis document collection, this system uses the Generalized Vector Space Model (GVSM) algorithm. GVSM is a development of the Vector Space Model (VSM) method. In searching for information from a collection of documents, GVSM will see the meaning relationship between terms in the document so that it will improve relevant search results based on queries provided by users. This system was tested using 50 thesis documents and 5 keywords so that the average recall value was 100%, Precision 82.91%, and F-Measure 90.36%.
